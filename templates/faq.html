<h2>Installation and System Requirements</h2>

      macOS Says You Are an Unidentified Developer!
    </a>
    <div id="unidentified" class="content">
      <p>
        When you first download and open MacDown,
        you might see a window like this:
      </p>

      <img class="squeeze"
          src="{{ '/static/images/macdown-cant-open.png'|url }}"
          alt="macOS app block warning.">

      <p>
        This is because I do not own a registered Mac developer certificate
        (which can be obtained if and only if you
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mac/">pay</a>
        $99 a year to Apple), and macOS does not allow installation of
        applications without certificates by default. This can be overridden
        in the “Security &amp; Privacy” pane in System Preferences:
      </p>

      <img class="squeeze"
          src="{{ '/static/images/security-privacy-preferences.png'|url }}"
          alt="macOS Security &amp; Privacy preferences.">

      <p>
        Click “Open Anyway” to authorise MacDown, or select the “Anywhere”
        radio button to allow all unidentified apps (including MacDown) to
        open in the future. You may need to click at the lock in the bottom
        left and enter your password first.

    <a href="#ports">Will You Support Other Platforms?</a>
    <div id="ports" class="content">
      <p>
        I did have plans to build some kind of ports.
        Most of MacDown’s core functionalities are based on C libraries
        (except autocomplete), so it won’t be hard to replicate something
        similar with other GUI frameworks.
        I don’t currently have the time, but I’ll be more than happy to share
        the details if you are interested.
      </p>

  <dd class="accordion-navigation">
    <a href="#older-osx">How About macOS Versions Earlier Than 10.8?</a>
    <div id="older-osx" class="content">
      <p>
        The main problem here is that I don’t have enough resources to
        promise API compatibility without seriously slowing down development.
        Unless I build some kind of CI services, backward compatibility is
        easier said than done.
      </p>

      <p>
        One possibility here, however, is to provide support via a
        cross-platform port (see previous question). As far as I know,
        most cross-platform GUI frameworks support all the way back to 10.6,
        so this could be a stone that kills two birds.
        <em>If</em> someone does that.

    <a href="#gfm">Do You Support GFM?</a>
    <div id="gfm" class="content">
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">GFM</a>
        (GitHub Flavoured Markdown) is a mix of standard Markdown,
        and some non-standard syntaxes that add additional functionalities
        and/or more ease for a particular group of people to write.
        MacDown provides lots of switches to let you choose what
        non-standard syntax(es) you want to use,
        and you can get almost all features in GFM if you configure
        them correctly.
        Check out the <a href="{{ '/features/'|url }}">Features</a> page
        to find out what extensions MacDown provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        MacDown can be compatible to GFM,
        except for some minor structural differences in the resulting HTML,
        by enabling (only) the follwing options in the “Markdown”
        preference pane:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tables.</li>
        <li>Fenced code blocks.</li>
        <li>Strikethrough.</li>
        <li>Autolink.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And “Task list syntax” in the <strong>Rendering</strong>
        preference pane.

    <a href="#vim">Will There Be a VIM Mode?</a>
    <div id="vim" class="content">
      <p>
        No. VIM edit mode is a topic too big.
        I leveraged a lot on macOS’s built-in text editing functionalities
        when implementing the editor,
        and implementing VIM mode means that I’ll need to tear them all
        down and start from the ground up.
        This doesn’t fit well with the direction of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several VIM plugins that can achieve similar things,
        just search for vim markdown preview in your search engine.
        Or I would recommend Sublime Text instead if you really want
        something more GUI.
        Enabling extensions like <em>Vintage</em>, <em>Markdown Extended</em>
        (or <em>MarkdownEditing</em> or others, pick what suits you), and
        <em>Markdown Preview</em> should be enough.

        You can report any issues you encountered with MacDown at the project’s
        <a href="https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/issues">
          GitHub issue page</a>. Suggestions are also welcomed.
        If it is about this <em>site</em>, not MacDown itself,
        you can report them
        <a href="https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown-site/issues">
          here</a> instead. Please feel free to offer any advices,
        or send me a pull request with your implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s one exception to this: MacDown does not accept new code
        block syntax highlighting rules. Refer to the
        <a href="{{ '/features/'|url }}#syntax_highlighting_contributing">
          relevant section</a> for more information.

    <div id="swift" class="content">
      <p>
        MacDown was initiated shortly after Apple announced Swift.
        While Swift is truely a nice language,
        I do not think it is quite production-ready yet.
        I would very much like to use it in the future, though.
